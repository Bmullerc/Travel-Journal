### Challenge
This is a challenge from a React learning class from [Scrimba].(https://scrimba.com/) This is the [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/QG4cOExkdbIbhSfWJhs2gs/Travel-Journal) file of the Design, and the challenge is to build it as close as possible while using React lessons learned so far, which inlude Props, Components and an intro to APIs.

### My Solution
The layout turned out pretty much the same as the concept, but I decided to instead use my own "API data" instead of copying the given one to get a more personal and funny result. The places are not pointing towards the exact location on purpose (security) and the images are illustrative.

## Built With
- React
- SASS
- BEM

### My Process
- First I wrote what would be the "API" data for App
- Created the individual components, added a footer aswell
- Worked out the layout as close as possible to the original
- Worked on pulling the data and applying it to the individual cards using props
- Made sure everything worked. Images had to be put on the "public" folder to work correctly
- Added small details like the real google maps locations and pictures and also some small transition effects and hover/active styles.

### My Takeaways
- Amazed by the ability to scale apps/pages with a simple component concept using React
- Still a static page and a made up "API" but I can see how it would turn dynamic by pulling data and adding more cards "by itself"

### Going forward
- Studying a lot more React, currently learning the first hooks and styling
- Revisiting some important Javascript concepts and methods, like map/filter/reduce which are fundamental while working with React
- More practice, some concepts are harder to grasp without a lot of exercise
